      <h1> How the game works </h1>
      <p>
        In this multi-player game, you will be in a group. Each person is given
        a set amount of coins at the start of each round. You will also be shown
        a money multiplier. There will be a public fund that you can choose to
        contribute to—you will not be able to see others' contributions before
        making your own. After everyone has contributed, the amount in the
        public fund will be multiplied by the money multiplier.
      </p>

      <p>
        This amount is then evenly divided among the group as the "payoff". You
        get to keep the payoff and whatever you have left of your private funds.
        The diagram below shows an example:
      </p>

      <img
        className="public-fund-img"
        src="experiment/images/explanation.png"
        width="50%"
      />

      <p>
        In this example, three players chose to contribute all 20 coins they
        were granted for the round, while one player contributed 0 coins. The
        total contribution, 60 coins, is then multiplied by a factor of 2,
        making the total size of the public fund then 120 coins, which is
        equally distributed among the four players.
      </p>

      <h1> Total coins and cash earnings </h1>

      <p>
        You will have a total balance of coins throughout the game, with each
        round's earnings being added to this amount. Try to maximize your total
        coins! When the game concludes, the coins will be converted to a cash
        bonus towards your final payment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          You will receive a base payment of ${treatment.basePay} for your
          participation in the game, in addition to $1 per{" "}
          {treatment.conversionRate} coins earned. To receive the bonus payment,
          please be sure to stay for all rounds of the game; the exit survey
          marks the end of the game. If you are detected to be idle, you forfeit
          the bonus amount.
        </strong>
